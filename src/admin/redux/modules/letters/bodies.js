  We notice that your Standing Order which is normally paid on ${formatDate(member.due_date)} each year has not been paid this year and ${formatPounds(member.amount)} has now been unpaid for over ${getOverdue(member.overdue)} days. We assume that this is probably an administrative error and would be very grateful if you could look into it.


  If, alternatively, your intention is to cancel your membership of the Friends weâ€™d be grateful if you could let the Membership Secretary (Pam Marrs, 42 Bracklesham Road, Hayling Island PO11 9SJ) know that that is your intention.


  If you have already sorted the problem out, our apologies and please ignore this letter.



  Sincerely,

  Chris Williams,
  Treasurer,
  Friends of Chichester Harbour

Your annual membership for the Friends of Chichester Harbour is due for renewal on ${formatDate(due_date)}.

I very much hope that you will continue your membership in support of our voluntary activities around the harbour.  Your membership subscription is critical to the significant financial assistance we give to the Conservancy and other organisations around the harbour.  The grants we provide support projects and activities that otherwise just would not take place, and help to conserve, preserve and educate for the future.  As well as the considerable financial assistance we give, the Friends provide work parties, every week all year round, which take part in essential maintenance and repairs to the footpaths and nature reserves across the harbour.  If you would like more details about the grants we have provided, or the work parties we organise, please visit our website at www.friendsch.org.
If as part of your membership you would like to be more involved please let us know.
