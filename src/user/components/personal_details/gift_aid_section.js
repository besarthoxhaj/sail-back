        You can boost the value of your subscription/donation to the Friends by 25p of
        Gift Aid for every Â£1 subscribed/donated. Gift Aid is reclaimed by the Friends
        from the tax you pay for the current tax year. If you wish to Gift Aid your
        subscription/donations to the Friends for this year, future years and the past
        4 years please tick the box below.

            I wish to make a Gift Aid Declaration to the Friends. I am a UK taxpayer and
            understand that if I pay less Income Tax and/or Capital Gains Tax than the
            amount of Gift Aid claimed on all my donations in that tax year it is my
            responsibility to pay any difference.
